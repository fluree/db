//! Transaction submission traits and consensus implementations for Fluree DB.
//!
//! This crate defines the abstraction by which transactions are submitted
//! and accepted into a ledger. Each implementation has its own trust model
//! and durability mechanism:
//!
//! - [`MonolithicConsensus`] — a single integrated unit handles every
//!   transaction; the local execution stream is the agreement. Used for
//!   development, testing, and deployments that do not need cross-node
//!   coordination.
//!
//! Future implementations (Raft for crash-fault tolerance, BFT for byzantine
//! tolerance) will live alongside, behind the same [`Submitter`] trait.
//!
//! Submission identity and status lookup are driven by optional
//! [`IdempotencyKey`]s. Callers who want idempotent retry or after-the-fact
//! status lookup generate a key (typically a ULID) and include it in their
//! [`TransactionRequest`]; submissions sharing a key collapse to a single
//! outcome. Callers who don't need those guarantees may omit the key.
