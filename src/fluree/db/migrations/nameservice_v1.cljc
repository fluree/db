  "Nameservice Migration to ns@v1 Format
  
  This migration handles the transition from the legacy nameservice format to the new
  ns@v1 directory structure with minimal storage records.
  
  WHAT IT DOES:
  - Detects old nameservice files stored at root level (e.g., ledger-name.json)
  - Extracts essential metadata from full commit JSON-LD records
  - Creates new minimal records with only: commit address, t value, index address
  - Stores them in the new ns@v1/ directory with branch-aware naming (ledger-name@branch.json)
  - Cleans up old files after successful migration
  
  WHEN IT RUNS:
  - Automatically at file storage initialization if old format is detected
  - Only runs once when ledger directories exist but no ns@v1/ directory is present
  
  SAFETY:
  - Read-only detection phase before any modifications
  - Sequential processing with proper error handling
  - Old files only deleted after successful migration
  - Logging for monitoring and debugging"
