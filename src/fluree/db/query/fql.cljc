(defn vswap!
  "This silly fn exists to work around a bug in go macros where they sometimes clobber
  type hints and issue reflection warnings. The vswap! macro uses interop so those forms
  get macroexpanded into the go block. You'll then see reflection warnings for reset
  deref. By letting the macro expand into this fn instead, it avoids the go bug.
  I've filed a JIRA issue here: https://clojure.atlassian.net/browse/ASYNC-240
  NB: I couldn't figure out how to get a var-arg version working so this only supports
  0-3 args. I didn't see any usages in here that need more than 2, but note well and
  feel free to add additional arities if needed (but maybe see if that linked bug has
  been fixed first in which case delete this thing with a vengeance and remove the
  refer-clojure exclude in the ns form).
