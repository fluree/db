(defn submit-command-async
  "INTERNAL USE ONLY

  Submits a fully signed command to the connected ledger group.
  Commands have two required keys:
    - cmd  - a map with the transactional data as a JSON string
    - sig - the signature of the stringified tx map

  Command ids are the sha3 of the cmd, and can be used to reference command status
  or look them up (i.e. a transaction command id is the txid.)

  The stringified cmd contains a payload that is a map, a transaction example follows:

  {:type   tx               - command type is required on all commands
   :ledger testnet/myledger - ledger name
   :tx     [{...}, {...}]   - transactional data
   :auth   ABC12345676      - only required if using an authority's signature, else inferred from signature
   :fuel   10000            - max fuel to spend, only required if enforcing fuel limits. tx will fail if auth doesn't have this much fuel avail. Will fail if all fuel is consumed. Unused fuel will not be debited.
   :nonce  1234             - nonce ensures uniqueness, making sure two identical transactions have different txids
   :expire 1547049123614    - don't even attempt this transaction after this moment in time
   :deps   []               - optional one or more txids that must execute successfully before this tx executes
                              if any of the txs in deps fail, this tx will fail
  }

  {:type   tx-cancel
   :txid   DSFGFHSDDF  - txid you wish to cancel
  }


  A new ledger command looks like:
  Note new ledgers are issued as a command, and auth/signature should have proper authority on ledger servers.
  {:type      new-ledger       - command type is required on all commands
   :ledger    testnet/myledger - ledger name - as network/ledger
   :fork      testnet/forkdb   - optional name of db to fork, if forking. Use testnet/$forkdb to peg to a dbid
   :forkBlock 42               - if forking a db, optionally provides a block to fork at, else will default to current block
   :auth      ABC12345676      - only required if using an authority's signature
   :fuel      10000            - max fuel to spend, only required if enforcing fuel limits. tx will fail if auth doesn't have this much fuel avail. Will fail if all fuel is consumed. Unused fuel will not be debited.
   :nonce     1234             - nonce ensures uniqueness, making sure two identical transactions have different txids
   :expire    1547049123614    - don't even attempt this transaction after this moment in time

(defn transact-async
  "Submits a transaction for a ledger and a transaction. Returns a core async channel
  that will eventually have either the result of the tx, the txid (if :txid-only option used), or
  an exception due to an invalid transaction or if the timeout occurs prior to a response.

  Will locally sign a final transaction command if a private key is provided via :private-key
  in the options, otherwise will submit the transaction to the connected ledger and request signature,
  provided the ledger group has a default private key available for signing.

  Options (opts) is a map with the following possible keys:
  - private-key - The private key to use for signing. If not present, a default
                  private key will attempt to be used from the connection, if available.
  - auth        - The auth id for the auth record being used. The private key must
                  correspond to this auth record, or an authority of this auth record.
  - expire      - When this transaction should expire if not yet attempted.
                  Defaults to 5 minutes.
  - nonce       - Any long/64-bit integer value that will make this transaction unique.
                  By default epoch milliseconds is used.
  - deps        - List of one or more txids that must be successfully processed before
                  this tx is processed. If any fail, this tx will fail. (not yet implemented)
  - txid-only   - Boolean (default of false). If true, will not wait for a response to the tx,
                  but instead return with the txid once it is successfully persisted by the
                  transactors. The txid can be used to look up/monitor the response at a later time.
  - timeout     - will respond with an exception if timeout reached before response available."

    "Returns a lazy sequence of raw flakes from the blockchain history from

  A nil start defaults to the genesis block. A nil end includes the last block of the known database.
  A positive integer for either start/end indicates a block number, a negative integer indicates a
  transaction number.

  Results can potentially include the entire database depending on your filtering criteria,
  so be sure to only 'pull' items as you need them.

  The optional map of filter criteria has the following keyed options:

  :subject    - Limit results to only include history of this subject, specified as either an _id or identity.
               Note the results are no longer lazy when using this option.
  :predicate - Limit results to only include history for this predicate. Must be used in conjunction with subject.
               If there is a need to get history of all subjects for a specific predicate, see 'range-history'.
  :limit     - Limit results to this quantity of matching flakes
  :offset    - Begin results after this number of matching flakes (for paging - use in conjunction with limit)
  :chunk     - Results are fetched in chunks. Optionally specify the size of a chunk if optimization is needed."

  Match predicates can be one of: =, >, >=, <, <= as either a string or symbol. If two matches are
  provided, one must be a > or >=, and the other a < or <=. An = predicate is only allowed with a single
  match statement, and acts the same providing two match statements: >= match <= match]

  Matches are a vector containing the flake components desired for a match, in the order dictated
  by the specified index. For example, if an spot index is used, the order is [s, p, o]. If an post
  index is used, the order is [p, o, s]. The match vector can be a one, two, or three-tuple depending
  on the specificity desired for the match. For example, for an spot index where the match should include
  all predicates from subject 42, the match clause could be either [42], [42, nil] or [42, nil, nil].
  Unlike the 'flakes' function, nil values in a match are only valid if no non-nil value follows.

   Opts may be provided. opts is a map containing any of the optional keys:

   :limit  - Limit results to this quantity
   :history  - Return the history of this range
   :from-block - Only applicable for history, return history up until a certain block
   :chunk  - Results are fetched in chunks. Optionally specify the size of a chunk if optimization is needed.
   :test  - Running as a test. Makes sure, i.e. index ranges are not cached."
