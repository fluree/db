   These tests require Docker to be installed and running. They are tagged with
   ^:docker meta tag and are excluded from regular CI/CD runs.
   
   To run these tests:
   - All docker tests: clojure -M:docker-tests
   - Specific test: clojure -M:cljtest -m kaocha.runner --focus fluree.db.storage.s3-testcontainers-test
